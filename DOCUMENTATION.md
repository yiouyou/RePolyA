## Introduction

RePolyA is designed with adaptability in mind, aiming to fit various research domains. This documentation focuses on guiding users through the process of running two of its primary use cases.

## Getting Started

Before running the cases, ensure you have:

1. **Cloned the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url> && cd RePolyA`
2. **Set up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Installed Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Configured the Environment**: Follow our [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/yiouyou/RePolyA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md) to set up necessary keys and settings.

## Running the Cases

### Stakeholder Analysis of Hot Events

This module helps analyze the stakeholders involved in major events.

**How to Run**:

1. Navigate to the relevant directory: `cd path/to/module`
2. Execute the main script, for example: `python stakeholder_analysis.py`
3. Follow on-screen prompts or provide necessary input.

### Topical Research of Biotech Companies

Dive deep into specific topics related to biotech companies with this module.

**How to Run**:

1. Change to the respective directory: `cd path/to/biotech_module`
2. Run the primary script: `python biotech_research.py`
3. Engage with any on-screen instructions or provide the required data.

Each module may have additional parameters or configurations which are detailed in their respective directories or READMEs.

## Troubleshooting

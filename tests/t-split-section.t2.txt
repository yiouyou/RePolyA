Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning are transforming drug
research and development (R&D), enabled by ever-increasing amounts of data and
computational power. Historically, small molecules have been at the forefront of AI
applications in drug discovery, including modelling small-molecule–target
interactions, lead candidate optimization and safety prediction. However, AI tools are
increasingly being applied to large-molecule modalities, including antibodies, gene
therapies and RNA-based therapies. Such therapies represent an important share of
the biopharma industry’s current portfolio — around 40% of new molecules
approved in 2022 — and of its future commercial potential. For example, in oncology,
large molecules are forecast to represent ~50% of the market by revenue in 2030, of
which more than 80% is expected to be derived from antibodies.
In this article, we outline how AI-based approaches are being applied in large-
molecule drug discovery, analyse the landscape of companies developing these
approaches and their pipelines, and provide a perspective on what is required for the
biopharma industry to implement these approaches successfully.

Machine learning tools are being applied in many areas of drug R&D. Here, we focus
on three overlapping aspects of large-molecule drug discovery — structural
predictions, functional predictions and new candidate generation — where
approaches are maturing quickly. Applications of machine learning in drug
development, such as tools to predict responsive patient populations, or to derisk or
accelerate trials, are not covered.
Tools to predict large-molecule structure. Prediction of protein structures is valuable
for large-molecule drug discovery in areas ranging from target identification (such as
predicting antigen structure) through to lead identification and optimization. The
success of AlphaFold2, a machine learning model, in predicting three-dimensional
protein structure from amino acid sequences alone was a landmark advance in 2020.
Many companies in the field are now using AlphaFold2 or other protein structure
prediction models with similar accuracy, such as RoseTTAFold. Ongoing
developments are improving aspects such as ease-of-use, scalability, performance on
orphan proteins and re-trainability (for example, ColabFold, FastFold, OmegaFold
and OpenFold), and increasing generalization and speed using different architectures
that are similar to large language models such as GPT-4 (for example, ESMFold).
Tools to predict large-molecule functions. AI tools have been developed to support
the prediction of the functions of large-molecule therapeutic candidates, including
antigen–antibody or RNA–protein binding, as well as aspects relevant to their
developability, such as pharmacokinetic clearance. These predictions can be made
using machine learning models such as gradient-boosted trees or computational
models such as molecular dynamics simulations. More recently, deep learning
methods have been used, including graph-based models, convolutional neural
networks, recurrent neural networks or ‘large-molecule language models’, to predict
key therapeutic properties such as antibody affinity. Various representations of large
molecules can be used by these methods; for example, three-dimensional coordinates
of antibody–antigen amino acids, or sequences of amino acids or nucleotides for
convolutional neural network or large-molecule language model architectures.
Generating large-molecule therapeutic candidates. Rapidly growing data
availability is supporting the development of algorithms that can generate proteins,

antibodies or mRNAs at scale as part of lead generation or optimization; for example,
based on diffusion, variational autoencoder models or through employing large
language models similar to GPT-4 trained on data specific for the modality, such as
protein sequences.
Specific examples where such algorithms have been implemented include
development of novel antigen structures, determining optimal mRNA structure for
stability and immunogenicity, and novel protein and antibody design. Designed
molecules are often subsequently assessed in high-throughput systems to
experimentally confirm functional properties and further reinforce and improve
candidate generation.
The tools described above are versatile; for example, RFdiffusion or the ESM family of
models have been used for novel protein generation as well as structural and
functional predictions. These tools are now complementing or replacing traditional
computational approaches. Examples of the application of AI tools in the antibody
discovery pipeline are highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Emerging company landscape
We analysed the landscape for AI-driven biotech companies engaged in large-
molecule drug design and identified 82 companies active in this field (Fig. 1a;
Supplementary Table 1). More than 60% of these companies were founded in the past
5 years, indicating a nascent industry driven by recent technological step changes,
such as the advent of AlphaFold. There is also some emerging evidence of
consolidation amongst these companies, such as iBio’s acquisition of RubrYc
Therapeutics in 2022.

The companies analysed in this space raised US$3.9 billion in 2021, with $2.7 billion of
this being raised by venture capital firms alone (Fig. 1b). Total investment declined
significantly in 2022, however, to $0.7 billion (Fig. 1a). Notable activity includes
AbCellera and Absci (both focused on antibody discovery) raising $555 million and
$200 million, respectively, in initial public offerings in 2020 and 2021, and Generate
Biomedicines (focused on protein drug discovery) raising $370 million in series B
funding in 2021.
Established biopharma companies are investing in building AI capabilities for large-
molecule drug discovery both internally and through acquisitions, such as
Genentech’s 2021 acquisition of Prescient Design, an AI-driven biotech applying
machine learning to antibody discovery. Established large biopharma companies
have also partnered with AI-driven biotech companies, with 51 partnerships
identified in 2021, up from 10 partnerships in 2016 (Fig. 1a). Examples of deals
include partnerships between BigHat Biosciences (focused on antibody discovery)
with Amgen, AbCellera with AbbVie, and MAbSilico (focused on antibody
discovery) with OSE Immunotherapeutics.
The pipelines of AI-driven biotechs are currently at an early stage (Fig. 1c). Three
assets were identified in phase II: Evaxion is developing a peptide-based personalized
cancer immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, ZielBio is developing a monoclonal
antibody against plectin for solid tumours and PharmCADD has an mRNA vaccine
candidate for SARS-CoV-2.
There are also three assets in phase I: Peptilogics’ peptide antibiotic for periprosthetic
joint infection, SparX Therapeutics’ monoclonal antibody targeting claudin 18.2 for
gastric carcinoma and another mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 from
PharmCADD.
Companies developing these molecules have reported leveraging AI-based target
identification, functional (binding) prediction and antibody generation (including the
use of generative AI) as part of candidate development. Details of the molecules in
clinical development are available in Supplementary Table 2.

In the preclinical pipeline, the largest group of assets under development by AI-
driven biotech companies is in the oncology area, with eight molecules. With regard
to modality, there are more RNA therapeutics and peptides in preclinical
development (~50% of all molecules) than antibody therapeutics. This is potentially
owing to the higher complexity of antibody design and lack of functional data with
which to train machine learning tools.
Outlook
Our analysis indicates that the application of AI in large-molecule drug discovery is
increasing rapidly. However, while the potential value of these tools has been
convincingly demonstrated in academic settings, deployment at scale has so far
proved challenging.
Several elements need to be addressed to realize the potential of AI in the field. First,
AI models must be fully integrated into research processes, with appropriate
capability building of research scientists. By doing so, companies can rapidly train
and validate machine learning algorithms, whilst also overcoming potential ‘siloing’
of AI efforts. For example, when using a large language model for high-throughput
prediction of antibody affinity, timely validation in vitro through integrated research
systems will further train and enhance the performance of in silico models. Second,
technical environments must be established, such as complex data engineering
pipelines (integrating and capable of automating labelling of public and internal
data), suitable computational infrastructure, and integration of source system
modelling environments. This enables companies to train and refine AI models at a
rate that can inform and improve the next experiment. Finally, AI technologies need
to be combined across the R&D process beyond drug discovery, into areas such as
trial design and identification of patient subpopulations to further improve trial
efficiency and probability of success.

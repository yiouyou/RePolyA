Abstract
Generative artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly increase the speed,
quality and controllability of antibody design. Traditional de novo antibody discovery
requires time and resource intensive screening of large immune or synthetic libraries.
These methods also oﬀer little control over the output sequences, which can result in
lead candidates with sub-optimal binding and poor developability attributes. Several
groups have introduced models for generative antibody design with promising in sil-
ico evidence [1–10], however, no such method has demonstrated generative AI-based de
novo antibody design with experimental validation. Here we use generative deep learning
models to de novo design antibodies against three distinct targets, in a zero-shot fashion,
where all designs are the result of a single round of model generations with no follow-up
optimization. In particular, we screen over 1 million antibody variants designed for bind-
ing to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) using our high-throughput
wet lab capabilities. Our models successfully design all CDRs in the heavy chain of
the antibody and compute likelihoods that are calibrated with binding. We achieve
binding rates of 10.6% and 1.8% for heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) and HCDR123 de-
signs respectively, which is four and eleven times higher than HCDR3s and HCDR123s
randomly sampled from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) [11]. We further char-
acterize 421 AI-designed binders using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ﬁnding three
that bind tighter than the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab. The binders are highly
diverse, have low sequence identity to known antibodies, and adopt variable structural
conformations. Additionally, the binders score highly on our previously introduced Nat-
uralness metric [12], indicating they are likely to possess desirable developability proﬁles
and low immunogenicity. We open source1 the HER2 binders and report the measured
binding aﬃnities. These results unlock a path to accelerated drug creation for novel
therapeutic targets using generative AI and high-throughput experimentation.

Introduction
Antibodies are a growing class of therapeutic molecules [13] due to their attractive
drug-like properties, including high target selectivity and minimal immunogenic eﬀects
[14]. Antibody drug development commonly begins with initial lead molecule discovery.
Existing approaches for lead discovery typically consist of randomly searching through
a massive combinatorial sequence space by screening large libraries of random antibody
variants against a target antigen. Techniques such as phage display [15], yeast display
[16], immunization coupled with hybridoma screening [17] or B-cell sequencing [18]
are typically employed for initial discovery, followed by further molecule development.
These methods are time and resource intensive, lack control over the properties of
the resulting antibodies, and often produce sub-optimal leads.
Applying generative
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to design de novo antibodies in a zero-shot and controllable
fashion, rather than screening and developing lead molecules, could drastically reduce
the time and resources necessary for therapeutic antibody development. The application
of AI methods to antibody design, and more generally protein therapeutic design, is
compelling given the availability of large protein sequence and structure databases that
can be used for model training [11,19–46]. Indeed, recent work [47–51] has shown that
models trained on these data could be used for the de novo design of certain classes of
proteins. These works screen dozens to thousands of protein designs, representing two
to four orders of magnitude fewer proteins than are validated in our study. Moreover, no
method has yet achieved zero-shot AI-based de novo design of antibodies with wet lab
validation, despite the immense therapeutic relevance of antibody-based therapeutics
which accounted for 30% of FDA approved biologics in 2022 [52].
Here, we follow the deﬁnition of zero-shot as provided in the GPT-3 [53] and ESM-
1v [54] papers. For antibodies, this means designing an antibody to bind to an antigen
with no previous demonstrations of binders to said antigen. In other words, the model
is used directly for design and no further optimization is performed. We also go further
to show that our design process is de novo, which is traditionally deﬁned as the design
of proteins from ﬁrst principles or more broadly the use of engineering principles to
design antibodies from scratch [55, 56]. To demonstrate this, we remove training data
containing antibodies known to bind the target or any homolog to the target, which
means the model needs to design the antibody from scratch or de novo. Several works
[57–60] have succeeded in optimizing antibodies using supervised learning, though none
have validated zero-shot or de novo antibody design with experimental validation. Our
work focuses on the experimental validation of a generative AI approach. We leave
discussion of modeling and ablation studies to possible follow up publications.
Many groups have recognized the potential of zero-shot generative AI to impact an-
tibody design. Several methods have recently emerged, leveraging ideas from language
modeling to geometric learning, for the design of antibodies [1–10]. As in our work,
these papers focus on the design of the complementary determining regions (CDRs),
as these are the key determinants of antibody function and interact directly with the
antigen [61–63]. However, no such method has been able to demonstrate de novo anti-
body design in a zero-shot fashion with validation in the lab. Key to our work is the
integration of novel generative modeling ideas with high-throughput experimentation
capabilities in the wet lab. Recent advancements in DNA synthesis and sequencing,
E. coli based antibody expression, and ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting have made it
possible to experimentally assess hundreds of thousands of individual designs rapidly
and in parallel [64].
Here we demonstrate zero-shot antibody design with extensive wet lab experimen-
tation. As a ﬁrst step towards fully de novo antibody design, we show that all CDRs
in the heavy chain of an antibody can be designed with generative AI methods using
trastuzumab and its target antigen, HER2, as a model system [65, 66]. All antibodies

that bind HER2 or homologs of HER2 are removed from the training set. We screen over
1 million unique HCDR3 and HCDR123 variants of trastuzumab and screen for bind-
ing to HER2 using our proprietary Activity-speciﬁc Cell-Enrichment (ACE) assay [64].
From these designs, we functionally validate 421 binders using SPR. Not only do the
designed binders possess sequence novelty compared to those found in the training
dataset, they are also highly diverse and dissimilar to anything previously observed in
structural antibody databases [22] or massive datasets of known antibodies [11]. Accord-
ing to our previously described Naturalness metric [12], the designed binders are likely
to be developable and possess favorable immunogenicity characteristics. Furthermore,
3D predicted structures of the de novo designed HCDR3s bound to HER2 reveal large
conformational variability but discrete spatially conserved side chains when compared
to trastuzumab. We show the extensibility of our approach by designing and validating
binding molecules to two additional antigens: human vascular endothelial growth factor
A (VEGF-A) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (COVID-19 Omicron variant).
An earlier version of this manuscript in January 2023 focused on the in silico design
of heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3).
In a revision (March 2023) the model is applied
to the design of all three heavy chain CDRs (HCDR123). Additional changes in the
revision (March 2023) include extensive characterization of model binding rates (>10%
for HCDR3, >1% for HCDR123) and execution of the largest biological baseline study
in the ﬁeld of generative AI-based de novo antibody design. Taken together, this work
paves the way for rapid progress toward fully de novo antibody design using generative
AI, which has the potential to revolutionize the availability of therapeutics for patients.

Results
Screening model generated sequences for binding
We leverage our previously described ACE assay (Materials and Methods) [12, 64] to
screen massive antibody variant libraries containing hundreds of thousands of members
expressed in Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) format. We validate the ACE assay for
our de novo discovery workﬂow by sampling sequences for follow-up analysis by SPR
(Materials and Methods, Figure S1), an industry standard in binding aﬃnity measure-
ment and detection. We ﬁnd that the ACE assay is routinely able to classify binders
(Materials and Methods) with nearly 95% precision and >95% recall (Table S1, S2,
Figure S2). This enables a powerful workﬂow where a large population of predictions
can be initially screened by the ACE assay and the expected binding population can be
subsequently screened via SPR to remove false positives and collect high quality binding
aﬃnity measurements (Figure 1). The high precision and high recall oﬀered by ACE
allows us to measure binding rates and compare them across populations. In any direct
comparison shown based on ACE data, sequences from all populations are synthesized
in the same library and screened in the same ACE assay.

Zero-shot design of all heavy chain CDRs signiﬁcantly outper-
forms biological baselines
Experimental setup.
Here, we demonstrate the ability of generative AI models to
de novo design antibodies targeting speciﬁc antigens. To this end, we generate heavy
chain CDR3 (HCDR3) and all heavy chain CDR (HCDR123) sequences in a zero-shot
fashion.
We focus on design of CDRs, key determinants of antibody function, due
to their high sequence diversity in immune repertoires and high density of paratope
residues [63].
We select trastuzumab, which binds to HER2, as a scaﬀold antibody
to test designed HCDR sequences. We design HCDRs using a model conditioned on
the HER2 antigen backbone structure derived from PDB:1N8Z (Chain C) [67] and the
trastuzumab framework sequences. None of the CDRs (including light chain CDRs) are
provided to the model as inputs.
Furthermore, to show that the model leverages antigen information, we also design
HCDRs using a model conditioned on incorrect antigens, speciﬁcally rat HER2, HER3,
and VEGF, instead of human HER2. The sampled sequences are tested for binding to
human Her2. Structural inputs are described in Materials and Methods.

Training.
We remove any antibody known to bind the target or any homolog of the
target (>40% sequence identity or part of the same homologous superfamily) from the
training set. In some settings, we instead remove all antibodies from the training set
with >40% sequence identity to the wildtype antibody. In all cases, we observe binders.
For experiments comparing binding rates, we use the setting where any antibody known
to bind the target or any homolog of the target (>40% sequence identity) is removed
from the training set.
Inference.
We generate sequences using several in-house generative models and hy-
perparameter settings. We sample sequences from each model independently. Then,
we aggregate all designed sequences, compute likelihoods according to each model, and
take the average of those scores as the ﬁnal score used for ranking. Finally, we sample
the top k sequences (Materials and Methods) according to this ensembled score and
measure the binding rate of the population in the ACE assay (Materials and Methods).
A fraction of each library is also used for ablation studies (results not presented; used
for internal benchmarking) so the overall binding rate of the entire libraries (consisting
of hundreds of thousands of sequences) may appear lower than the top k binding rates
reported here.
As the optimal HCDR lengths cannot be known a priori, we sample sequences with
HCDR3 lengths corresponding to the distribution of HCDR3 lengths observed in OAS-
J (Table S4). This also enables a fair comparison to biological baselines. We always
sample HCDR1 and HCDR2 sequences with length 8, as these are the most frequent
lengths for HCDR1 (85.4% occurence) and HCDR2 (64.8% occurence) in OAS, as well
as the lengths of trastuzumab’s HCDR1 and HCDR2, as deﬁned by IMGT [68].
Biological baselines.
We compare the binding rates of our generative models to
relevant biological baselines, derived by sampling sequences from OAS and SAbDab
(Materials and Methods). We screen all unique HCDR3 and HCDR123s in SabDab and
randomly sample sequences from OAS. We present the number of binders and sequences
for each category in Table S5. We ﬁnd that the permuted sequences baseline performs
worst, which is expected given that randomly shuﬄing amino acids destroys positional
information. The OAS and SAbDab baselines perform similarly, while the OAS-J base-
line, which considers sequences from OAS that have the same J-gene as trastuzumab,
performs slightly better. This is expected because part of the antibody’s HCDR3 is
determined by its J-gene and so these sequences have signiﬁcantly higher homology to

trastuzumab on average. We ﬁnd that sequences from our models signiﬁcantly outper-
form each of these baselines.
Wet-lab validation.
To benchmark our models, we run the largest wet-lab validated
baseline study in the ﬁeld of generative AI-based de novo antibody design to date,
containing over 100,000 baseline sequences from OAS and SAbDab. We ﬁnd:
• AI models outperform biological baselines: Our de novo method achieves a
binding rate of 10.6% (HCDR3 design) and 1.8% (HCDR123 design), signiﬁcantly
outperforming the random OAS baseline by 4x and 11x, respectively (p < 10−5,
Fisher’s exact test). Sequences from the model are sampled according to the OAS-
J HCDR3 length distribution, enabling a fair comparison (Table 1).
• Antigen-Speciﬁcity: Performance drops signiﬁcantly (p < 10−2, Fisher’s exact
test) when using the incorrect antigen as an input, such as rat HER2, HER3, or
VEGF (Table 1), indicating the model’s use of antigen information for sequence
designs. We note that this has not been shown previously for any zero-shot de novo
antibody design model in the literature. In the case where the wrong antigen is
provided to our model, the resulting outputs generally perform similarly to random
OAS screening (Table 1) but as more samples are drawn they perform worse than
OAS (Table S3).
• Calibration: Model likelihood is calibrated with binding, meaning sequences
with higher likelihoods are more likely to bind, and therefore sequences can be
eﬀectively prioritized in an unsupervised zero-shot manner. We observe this by
noting that as more samples are drawn from the model, binding rates tend to
decrease (Table 2, S3).
Taken together, these results highlight the eﬀectiveness of Generative AI at designing
de novo antibodies in a zero-shot manner. The computational nature of the approach
can enable binder discovery in as few as four weeks (Figure 2).

Generative models produce diverse binders
We advance a subset of conﬁrmed binders from an earlier version of these screens for
further characterization and conﬁrm HER2 binding for 421 zero-shot AI designs using
SPR. Conﬁrmed binders (Figure 3A) show a range of aﬃnity to HER2, with 71 designs
exhibiting aﬃnities < 10nM (Figure 3B). Excitingly, three of the zero-shot designs dis-
play tighter binding than trastuzumab, with one binding with sub-nanomolar aﬃnity.
These high-aﬃnity designs are generated zero-shot from the model without any addi-
tional aﬃnity maturation, therefore skipping a typically critical step in the development
process of a therapeutic antibody [69]. The ability to generate desirable antibodies that
do not need additional optimization could signiﬁcantly reduce development timelines.
In addition to favorable aﬃnity, the AI model designs have high sequence diversity,
both in terms of amino acid length and identity. The veriﬁed binders have HCDR3s
ranging in length from 11 to 15 amino acids (Figure S3A), compared to the trastuzumab
HCDR3 length of 13. The designed sequences are also divergent from the trastuzumab
antibody, with edit distances between two and 12 from the trastuzumab sequence (Fig-
ure 3C). Average aﬃnity decreases as edit distance increases from the trastuzumab se-
quence, but interestingly we ﬁnd designs that still exhibit aﬃnity less than 10nM across
all edit distances. We observed one design with an edit distance of nine that exhibits
higher aﬃnity than the trastuzumab antibody. Additionally, we found higher diversity
in the centers of the HCDR3s, which corresponds to the more diverse D germline gene,
compared to the less diverse ﬂanking J and V germline genes [70]. The designs are also
sequence diverse from one another, with a mean edit distance of 7.7±2.1 SD (Figure 3D,
S3B). Inter-design diversity is noteworthy because it indicates model-generated binders
are not converging to shared sequence motifs, as is often seen with traditional antibody
screening methods like phage display [71].
Designed binders display sequence novelty
Despite the high sequence diversity of the 421 designed binders, one potential expla-
nation of the model’s success is simple reproduction of training examples. This phe-
nomenon has been observed in machine learning models. Indeed, prior methods for
generative drug design have been critiqued for generating molecules that are similar to
those previously known [72,73]. Therefore, we compute the minimum distance between
the designed binders and all HCDR3s in the model’s training and validation sets (Materi-
als and Methods), ﬁnding that designed binders are distinct from those observed during
training (Figure 4A). We next compute distances to all HCDR3s in the Structural Anti-
body Database (SAbDab) [22], a database of antibody-antigen complexes, ﬁnding that
the binder sequences are distant from all antibodies in the database (Figure S4A).
We examined the sequence similarity of the model’s outputs to sequences in the
Observed Antibody Space (OAS), a database of immune repertoire sequencing studies
[11]. We found generated HCDR3s that already exist in the OAS (including those paired
with other HCDRs), while others are unique with minimum HCDR3 edit distances
between one to ﬁve (Figure 4B). Minimum edit distances between all three HCDRs
and the HCDRs in OAS are shown in Figure S4B. These results indicate the model is
capable of generating biologically relevant yet diverse HCDR3 sequences.
Zero-shot designs are natural
Therapeutic antibody leads that are successful in the drug creation process typically
have high aﬃnity and are developable with low immunogenicity. In previous work, we
described a language model that can assign a score to antibody sequences indicating
the likelihood of ﬁnding a sequence in a typical immune repertoire [12]. This metric

both high aﬃnities and high Naturalness scores in a zero-shot manner, despite not train-
ing or sampling based on either metric (Figure 4C). Many designs exhibit Naturalness
scores higher than trastuzumab. Figure 4D shows the Naturalness scores for the de novo
binders as well as several baseline populations. See Table S6 for the mean Naturalness

De novo binders are those identiﬁed in our study. OAS refers to randomly selected
HCDR3s from OAS. Frequency baseline samples amino acids at each position based on
positional frequencies observed in OAS for HCDR3. The phage display baseline is a
set of HCDR3s sampled from binding and non-binding antibodies from Liu et al [74].

AI designs have signiﬁcantly higher Naturalness scores on average than the latter three

designs to bypass portions of the traditional lead optimization process, potentially sav-

Designed binders adopt variable binding mechanisms
We next predict structures for a diverse subset of our de novo designed HCDR3 variants

ods). To this end, we built structural models using eight HCDR3 candidates bound to

HER2 in Fab format. These eight variants are selected based on their edit distance to
the trastuzumab HCDR3, binding aﬃnity range (spanning three orders of magnitude)
and diversity in length (ranging from 12-15 amino acids) (Table 3, Figure S5).
We
use the trastuzumab Fab complex with HER2 (PDB:1N8Z) [67] as a starting template
for structural modeling. We run local constrained backbone geometry and side chain
rotamer optimization followed by relaxation of the complexes to correct global confor-
mational ambiguities, steric clashes, and sub-optimal loop geometry [75]. As a control,
we optimize the experimental trastuzumab complex with HER2 using the same protocol
for comparison with the optimized HCDR3 structural models. We use the lowest free
energy poses of the de novo HCDR3 models for structural analyses and comparisons.
Despite the sequence diversity, the eight de novo structural models are globally sim-
ilar to trastuzumab with all-atom HCDR3 RMSDs ranging from 1.9Å − 2.4Å. Minimal
structural rearrangements are observed in the unmodiﬁed regions of the heavy chain,
light chain and epitope residues of the antigen (Figure S6). In select cases, side chains
forming contacts with the HCDR3 show slight rotamer diﬀerences to account for the
presence of longer loops or steric clashes from residues with larger side chains (Figure S7).
Alignment of the designed HCDR3 regions with the trastuzumab-HER2 complex reveals
a dynamic ensemble of conformations adopted by each HCDR3 (Figure 5). HCDR3 loop
structural diﬀerences are broad, with RMSDs ranging from 1.1Å − 6.7Å when aligned
over all main chain and side chain atoms (Table 3). Even though the de novo HCDR3s
adopt distinct conformations, there are important positional similarities among all struc-
tures (Figure 5). A closer analysis of the spatial orientation of the side chain conformers
reveals conservation of identical side chains at ﬁve discrete spatial locations. Two of
these locations correspond to IMGT residue positions R106 and Y117 in trastuzumab,
which are highly conserved in most antibodies [76]. However, there is physiochemical
conservation in all structures corresponding to the spatial positions of IMGT residue
numbers W107, G109 and Y113 of trastuzumab, which contribute to the paratope of the
trastuzumab-HER2 complex [65]. Although conserved spatially, these side chains origi-
nate from multiple residue positions, highlighting that conformational ﬂexibility may be
required for orienting key paratope residues to form important interactions with HER2.
Although the overall binding region is identical, each designed HCDR3 exhibits dis-
tinct binding modes with the epitope. In most cases, novel interactions not observed
in the trastuzumab-HER2 complex are formed between the designed HCDR3s and do-
main IV of HER2 (Figure S7, S8). These interactions are diverse and consist of novel
hydrogen bonding interactions, nonpolar interactions, aromatic interactions, and elec-
trostatic interactions formed between each HCDR3 and two distinct surfaces in the
HER2 epitope (Figure S7). To further decipher the determinants of binding we cal-
culate the surface area buried by each HCDR3 variant when bound to HER2, which
is deﬁned as the binding interface area between paratope and epitope (denoted as In-
terface in Table 3).
In several cases, de novo HCDR3 variants show larger binding
interface areas than trastuzumab, which would imply novel interactions with the HER2
epitope. Interestingly, no correlation is observed between binding interface area and
binding aﬃnity. This suggests that hydrophobic contributions and surface area burial
are not key determinants of binding in the designed sequences. Moreover, speciﬁc con-
tacts formed between each designed HCDR3 and the epitope are critical to the binding
stability of the complex. Furthermore, we calculate the grand average of hydropathy
values (GRAVY) [77] of each HCDR3 variant, which deﬁnes the collective hydrophobic
properties summed over each residue. We compare this to the binding aﬃnities and
observe no correlation between aﬃnity and hydrophobicity, which further conﬁrms the
hydrophobic eﬀect is not the major determinant of binding for the de novo designed
HCDR3s (denoted as Hydropathy in Table 3). Combined, these results suggest that
the binding aﬃnities of the designed HCDR3s are intrinsic to the sequence design and

Validation on additional targets
We next conduct a pilot study to demonstrate the applicability of our approach to a
broader set of antigens. For these additional targets, we do not pre-screen by the ACE
assay. Rather, we sample a small number of sequences and validate binding by SPR. We
ﬁrst successfully design an HCDR3 variant of the therapeutic ranibizumab [78], which
binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) (Figure S9, S10). The
binder has an aﬃnity of 48.2 nM, as measured by SPR, compared to sub-nanomolar
binding of ranibizumab (0.37 nM). Additionally, the designed HCDR3 is highly divergent
from ranibizumab, with an edit distance of 13, and novel, with a minimum of 4 mutations
separating it from any HCDR3 in OAS.
We design HCDR3 variants of casirivimab [79], conditioned on the Omicron SARS-
CoV-2 spike RBD. Casirivimab binds to multiple COVID spike protein variants and, in
particular, binds weakly to Omicron. Using SPR, we measure casirivimab aﬃnity to
Omicron at KD = 240.0 nM (Figure S11, Table S7). We identify one AI-designed variant
that binds with similar aﬃnity to Omicron at KD = 179.7 nM (Table S7). Interestingly,
we observe no binding to other spike protein variants for our AI-design, suggesting
the potential for controllability of target speciﬁcity among homologous antigens. The
designed variant has a distinct HCDR3 sequence compared to casirivimab (Figure S12),
with an edit distance of 6 and a minimum edit distance of 2 from any HCDR3 in OAS.
Additionally, the HCDR3 has at least an edit distance of 4 from any HCDR3 in CoV-
AbDab [80].
These binding designs to two additional antigens highlight the extensibility of our
zero-shot design approach and indicate the potential for selective antigen controllability
with generative AI.
Mult-step CDR design
In an earlier version of this manuscript (January 2023), we reported successful design
of multiple HCDRs using a multi-step generative AI design method, which we validated
by SPR (Table S8). As of the March 2023 revision, we have deprecated this method
(Materials and Methods) internally in favor of our latest zero-shot methods, which have
now been validated for multiple HCDRs.
Discussion
A particularly diﬃcult aspect of antibody drug creation is the initial step of lead can-
didate identiﬁcation due to the labor intensive and uncontrolled nature of traditional
screening methods. Generative AI-based de novo design has the potential to disrupt
these shortcomings of the current drug discovery process. The zero-shot nature of our AI
design approach obviates the need for cumbersome library screening to identify binding
molecules, generating large time and cost savings. Furthermore, the controllable nature
of model-based design allows for the creation of proteins optimized for developability
and immunogenicity characteristics, mitigating downstream developability risks. The
high binding aﬃnities observed could obviate the need for aﬃnity maturation, represent-
ing additional time and cost savings. The approach could be deployed for sophisticated
design tasks with high therapeutic relevance such as highly speciﬁc epitope targeting.
Here we show important progress for de novo antibody design by demonstrating the
ability to generate, in a zero-shot fashion, novel antibody variants that confer binding
and natural sequence characteristics comparable and, in some cases, superior to the par-
ent antibody. We use our models to generate HCDR3 and HCDR123 designs in a de novo
fashion, achieving signiﬁcantly higher binding rates than relevant biological baselines.

Our AI-generated sequences are distinct from any observed in the model training set
and the vast majority are distinct from the known sequences in the OAS database [11],
yet maintain high Naturalness scores, showing the model can design antibody sequences
along a biologically feasible manifold. Furthermore, the designed sequences are highly
dissimilar from one another, indicating the ability to design a diverse solution set of
binding molecules.
Structural modeling of a subset of the de novo HCDR3 binders
reveals high backbone conformational variability, but preservation of important contact
positions with the HER2 antigen. Finally, we highlight the generalizability of our ap-
proach by deploying these generative design methods to distinct antigens.
Building on the demonstrated progress, future work will expand generative design
to enable the de novo design of all CDRs and framework regions, further diversifying
possible binding solutions. Developing epitope-speciﬁcity across multiple antigens for
antibody designs could allow for precise interaction with biologically relevant target
regions associated with disease mechanisms of action. In addition to advancements on
the generative modeling front, the speed and scale of wet lab validation for AI-generated
designs will progressively increase as the time and cost of DNA synthesis continue to
decline.
Our work represents an important advancement in in silico antibody design with the
potential to revolutionize the availability of eﬀective therapeutics for patients. Genera-
tive AI-designed antibodies will signiﬁcantly reduce development timelines by generating
molecules with desired qualities without the need for further optimization. Addition-
ally, the controllability of AI-designed antibodies will enable the creation of customized
molecules for speciﬁc disease targets, leading to safer and more eﬃcacious treatments
than would be possible by traditional development approaches. Our core platform of
generative AI design methods and high-throughput wet lab screening capabilities will
continue to drive progress on this front, unlocking new capabilities in the rapidly accel-
erating ﬁeld of protein therapeutic design.

Materials and Methods
Biological Baselines
We use the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) [11] and the Structural Antibody Database
(SAbDab) [22] to generate sets of biologically relevant sequences for comparison to our
generative models.
For heavy chain CDR3s (HCDR3s): The “Random OAS” baseline is constructed by
randomly sampling 50,000 unique HCDR3s from OAS with the only condition being
that they have a length between 9 and 17 amino acid residues (for parity with our
model generations). We similarly construct the “Random OAS-J” baseline by randomly
sampling 10,000 unique HCDR3s from OAS from antibodies that have the same J-gene
as trastuzumab, while also imposing the same length constraint as the OAS baseline.
For the “SAbDab” baseline we include all 2,395 unique HCDR3s from SAbDab that
have lengths between 9 and 17 residues and which do not belong to trastuzumab or its
variants. For the “Permuted Sequences” baseline we randomly sample a subset of 5,000
HCDR3s from the “Random OAS” baseline and randomly shuﬄe each sequence’s amino
acids to destroy positional information.
For all three heavy chain CDRs (HCDR123s): We take an analogous approach to
the HCDR3 baselines, except we restrict to sequences with HCDR1 and HCDR2 each of
length 8. We sample 50,000 sequences for “Random OAS” baseline, 10,000 sequences for
the “Random OAS-J” baseline, and all 1,572 unique HCDR123s from SAbDab ﬁtting
the length criteria.
Labeling Binders with ACE
To determine the success of the ACE assay we include several thousand controls (SPR-
validated binders and non-binders) in the libraries. The Binary ACE assay (bACE)
produces enrichment scores based on proportional abundances in the speciﬁed FACS
gates. The P1 and P2 enrichment scores are predictive of binding (Figure S2) based on
their separation of the binding and non-binding controls.
To label screened sequences as binders we use a threshold on the median P1 en-
richment score (across three replicates, R1, R2, R3) and a separate threshold on the
minimum P2 enrichment score (across the same three replicates as P1). Speciﬁcally,
given thresholds t1 and t2 we call a sequence a binder if:
Median(P1R1, P1R2, P1R3) > t1
OR
min(P2R1, P2R2, P2R3) > t2.
Otherwise, we label the sequence a non-binder.
We determine the thresholds t1, t2 using a grid-search aimed at maximizing F1-score
on the controls included in the library. For the heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) library we
ﬁnd that t1 = 3.51, t2 = 8.89 achieve the highest F1-score. For the all three heavy chain
(HCDR123) library we ﬁnd that t1 = 6.87, t2 = 3.05 achieve the highest F1-score.
Model Structural Inputs
As input to the models we provide an antigen structure and specify an epitope. For
the de novo setting we provide the structure of human HER2 from PDB:1N8Z (Chain
C) [67] and specify the trastuzumab epitope. In this setting, we successfully design
using versions of the antigen structure that contain variable amounts of noise or have
been relaxed with Rosetta2.
To show the model’s dependence on the antigen information, we attempt design with
three incorrect antigens, namely rat HER2, HER3, and VEGF. For rat HER2, we use

the structure from PDB:1N8Y (Chain A) [67]. For HER3, we use the structure from
PDB:7MN8 (Chain A) [81]. For VEGF, we use the structure from PDB:1CZ8 (Chains A,
B) [82]. For rat HER2 and HER3, we specify an epitope based on sequential/structural
homology to the trastuzumab epitope of human HER2.
For VEGF, we specify the
ranibizumab [78] epitope.
Binding Rate of Top k Sequences
To determine the top k sequences we sample k sequences according to model likelihood
and the OAS length distribution (Table S4). Speciﬁcally:
• Deﬁne Topℓ(kℓ) as the number of binders amongst the top kℓ sequences, according
to model likelihood, with HCDR3 lengths equal to ℓ.
• Let fℓ be the frequency of length ℓ HCDR3s in OAS-J for ℓ ∈ {9, 10, ..., 17}. Then
we take (k9, k10, ...k17) such that ∑17
ℓ=9 kℓ = k and the quantity ∑17
ℓ=9 |kℓ − k · fℓ|
is minimized.
• Let Top(k) binding rate = ∑17
ℓ=9 Topℓ(kℓ).
Comparing Binding Rates
For comparing binding rates between two populations we use Fisher’s exact test [83].
Speciﬁcally, if population 1 consists of b1 binders and n1 non-binders and population 2
consists of b2 binders and n2 non-binders then:
• The binding rates for population 1 and population 2 are given by r1 =
b1
b1+n1 and
r2 =
b2
b2+n2 , respectively.
• The ratio of population 1’s binding rate to population 2’s binding rate is r1
r2 .
• The p-value (from Fisher’s exact test) corresponding to the binding rates of pop-
ulation 1 and 2 is
p =
(b1+n1
b1
)(b2+n2
b2
)
(b1+n1+b2+n2
b1+b2
) .
Naturalness Score
The Naturalness score used in this study is computed using the pre-trained antibody
language model introduced in [12]. It is based on the pseudo-perplexity of the extended
CDRs (deﬁned by a union of the IMGT and Martin deﬁnitions [68,84]) of an antibody
heavy chain under the language model. This metric is shown to be predictive of desirable
therapeutic properties such as developability and lack of immunogenicity.
For HCDR3 variants, Naturalness scores are computed over a grafting of the HCDR3
into the trastuzumab scaﬀold. In addition to computing Naturalness scores for our de
novo binders, we include several baselines:
1. OAS: Consists of 1,000 HCDR3s randomly sampled from OAS. Antibody heavy
chain sequences are sampled and the HCDR3s are extracted. We expect sequences
from OAS to have high Naturalness scores, given that the Naturalness model is
pretrained on OAS, so we treat this as a positive control.
2. Frequency baseline: These are 1,000 sequences generated by randomly sampling
from a length-conditioned frequency distribution of amino acids in OAS. We com-
pute PL(ℓ), the probability that an HCDR3 in OAS has length ℓ, and then compute

the probability of sampling a particular sequence with length ℓ, using an indepen-
dent factorization based on amino acid frequencies at each position:
PH(s = a1a2 · · · al|L = ℓ) = P(s1 = a1|L = ℓ)P(s2 = a2|L = ℓ) · · · P(sℓ = aℓ|L = ℓ).
We sample 1,000 lengths ℓ1, ℓ2, ..., ℓ1000 ∼ PL and then sample 1,000 sequences
according to the sampled lengths: si ∼ PH|L=ℓi. For this baseline, we expect to
see a basic level of Naturalness scores since the statistics underlying OAS encode
information about biologically viable antibodies. However, despite the distribution
of each amino acid position independently matching the OAS distribution, the
sampling approach disregards positional dependencies between groups of amino
acids, so we expect lower Naturalness scores than those in the OAS baseline.
3. Phage display baseline: We randomly sample 1,000 HCDR3s from the ﬁrst round
of a phage display panning [74]. Antibody heavy chain sequences are sampled
and the HCDR3s are extracted. Note that this collection of sampled antibodies
consists of both non-binders and binders.
4. Scrambled OAS: This consists of permuted versions of the 1,000 HCDR3s in the
OAS control. For each such HCDR3, we permute its sequence 5 diﬀerent times,
compute Naturalness score using the permuted HCDR3, and report the average
across the 5 permutations. The motivation for this as a negative control is that
permuting a protein sequence destroys positional information. Lower Naturalness
scores of this baseline compared to the ﬁrst OAS baseline implies that the Natu-
ralness model is able to capture positional information, and is not just considering
amino acid composition.
We compare the Naturalness scores of our de novo designs to these controls using
two-sample t-tests (H0 : µ1 = µ2, Ha : µ1 ̸= µ2) and compare to trastuzumab using
one-sample t-tests with trastuzumab’s Naturalness score as the population mean (H0 :
µ1 = µ, Ha : µ1 ̸= µ).
Cloning
Antibody variants are cloned and expressed in Fab format.
To produce ACE assay
and SPR datasets, DNA variants of HCDR3 alone or spanning HCDR1 to HCDR3 are
purchased as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligo pools (Twist Bioscience). We spot
check selected binders by re-purchasing as double stranded DNA eBlocks (Integrated
DNA Technologies) or ssDNA oligo pools. Codons are randomly selected from the two
most common in E. coli B strain [85] for each residue.
Ampliﬁcation of the ssDNA oligo pools is carried out by PCR according to Twist
Bioscience’s recommendations, except Q5 high ﬁdelity DNA polymerase (New England
Biolabs) is used in place of KAPA polymerase. Brieﬂy, 25 µL reactions consist of 1x Q5
Mastermix, 0.3 µM each of forward and reverse primers, and 10 ng oligo pool. Reactions
are initially denatured for 3 min at 95◦C, followed by 13 cycles of: 95◦C for 20 s; 66◦C
for 20 s; 72◦C for 15 s; and a ﬁnal extension of 72◦C for 1 min. DNA ampliﬁcation is
conﬁrmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ampliﬁed DNA is subsequently puriﬁed
(DNA Clean and Concentrate Kit, Zymo Research).
To generate linearized vector, a two-step PCR is carried out to split our plasmid
vector carrying Fab format trastuzumab into two fragments in a manner that provides
cloning overlaps of approximately 25 nucleotides (nt) on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the ampli-
ﬁed ssDNA oligo pool libraries, or 40 nt on the 5’ and 3’ ends of IDT eBlocks. Vector
linearization reactions are digested with DpnI (New England Bioloabs) and puriﬁed
from a 0.8% agarose gel using the Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research) to eliminate

parental vector carry through. Cloning reactions consist of 50 fmol of each puriﬁed
vector fragment, either 100 fmol PCR-ampliﬁed ssDNA oligo pool or 10 pmol eBlock
library inserts and 1x ﬁnal concentration NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (New Eng-
land Biolabs). Reactions are incubated at 50◦C for 25 min using eBlocks or two hours
using PCR-ampliﬁed oligo pools. Assemblies are subsequently puriﬁed using the DNA
Clean and Concentrate Kit (Zymo Research). DNA concentrations are measured using
a NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
For HDLs, Transformax EPI300 (Lucigen) E. coli is transformed using the Mi-
croPulser Electroporator (BioRad) with the puriﬁed assembly reactions and recovered
in 1000 µL of SOC medium cultivated at 30◦C for 1 hour. The cell culture is then grown
in 20 mL of Teknova LB Broth with 50 µg/mL Kanamycin at 30◦C and 80 % humidity
with 270 rpm shaking for 18 hours. Plasmids are extracted (Plasmid Midi Kit, Zymo
Research) and submitted for QC sequencing. Electrocompetent SoluProTM host strain
is transformed with 20 ng of DNA and recovered in 500 µL of SOC medium cultivated
at 30◦C for 1 hour.
For LDLs, Absci SoluProTM host strain is transformed with the puriﬁed assembly
reactions and grown overnight at 30◦C on agar plates containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin
and 1 % glucose. Colonies are picked for QC analysis prior to cultivation for induction.
QC Analysis
Quality of high diversity variant libraries is assessed by deep sequencing. Brieﬂy, library
plasmid pools are ampliﬁed by PCR across the region of interest and sequenced with
2x150 or 2x300 nt reads using the Illumina MiSeq platform with 20 % PhiX. The PCR
reaction uses 10 nM primer concentration, Q5 2x master mix (New England Biolabs)
and 1 ng of input DNA diluted in H2O. Reactions are initially denatured at 98◦C for 3
min; followed by 30 cycles of 98◦C for 10 s, 59◦C for 30 s, 72◦C for 15 s; with a ﬁnal ex-
tension of 72◦C for 2 min. Sequencing results are analyzed for distribution of mutations,
variant representation, library complexity and recovery of expected sequences. Metrics
include coeﬃcient of variation of sequence representation, read share of top 1 % most
prevalent sequences and percentage of designed library sequences observed within the
library. Quality of low diversity variant libraries is assessed by performing rolling circle
ampliﬁcation (Equiphi29, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) on 24 colonies and sequencing us-
ing the Illumina DNA Prep, Tagmentation Kit (Illumina Inc.). Each colony is analyzed
for mutations from reference sequence, presence of multiple variants, misassembly, and
matching to a library sequence (Geneious Prime).
Antibody Expression in SoluProTM E. coli B Strain
After recovery in SOC medium, HDLs are grown in 50 mL of Teknova LB Broth with 50
µg/mL Kanamycin at 30◦C and 80 % humidity with 270 rpm shaking for 24 hours. After
24 hours, the pre-culture is diluted to OD600 = 1 in 100 mL induction base medium
(IBM) (4.5 g/L Potassium Phosphate monobasic, 13.8 g/L Ammonium Sulfate, 20.5
g/L yeast extract, 20.5 g/L glycerol, 1.95 g/L Citric Acid) containing inducers and
supplements (250 µM Arabinose, 50 µg/mL Kanamycin, 8 mM Magnesium Sulfate, 1
mM Propionate, 1X Korz trace metals) and grown for 16 hours in a 500 mL baﬄed ﬂask
at 26◦C and 80 % humidity with 270 rpm shaking. At the end of the 16 hours, 250 µL
aliquots adjusted to 20 % v/v glycerol are stored at -80◦C.
After transformation and QC of LDLs, individual colonies are picked into deep well
plates containing 400 µL of Teknova LB Broth 50 µg/mL Kanamycin and incubated
at 30◦C and 80 % humidity with 1000 rpm shaking for 24 hours. At the end of the 24
hours, 150 µL samples are centrifuged (3300 g, 7 min), supernatant decanted from the
pre-culture plate, and cell pellets sent for sequence analysis. 80 µL of the pre-culture is

transferred to 400 µL of IBM containing inducers and supplements as described above.
Culture is grown for 16 hours at 26◦C and 80 % humidity with 270 rpm shaking. After
16 hours, 150 µL samples are taken and centrifuged (3300 g, 7 min) into pellets with
supernatant decanting prior to being stored at -80◦C.
Activity-speciﬁc Cell-Enrichment (ACE) Assay
Cell Preparation
High-throughput screening of antigen-speciﬁc Fab-expressing cells is adapted from the
approach described in [12,64]. For staining, thawed glycerol stocks from induced cultures
are transferred to 0.7 ml matrix tubes (500 µL, OD600 = 2), centrifuged (4000 g, 5 min),
and resulting pelleted cells are washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA).
Washed cells are thoroughly resuspended in 250 µL of phosphate buﬀer (32 mM, pH 7.4)
by pipetting prior to ﬁxation by the addition of 250 µL of 0.6 % paraformaldehyde and
0.04 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate buﬀer (32 mM, pH 7.4). After 40 min incubation on
ice, samples are centrifuged (4000 g, 5 min) and pellets are washed three times with PBS
(pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA), resuspended in permeabilization buﬀer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM
glucose, 10 mM EDTA, 5 µg/mL rLysozyme), and incubated for 8 min on ice. Fixed
and permeabilized cells are then centrifuged (4000 g, 5 min) and washed three times
with staining buﬀer (Perkin Elmer AlphaLISA immunoassay buﬀer, 25 mM HEPES, 0.1
% casein, 1 mg/mL dextran-500, 0.5 % Triton X-100, 0.05 % Kathon).
Staining
Prior to library staining, the HER2 probe is titrated against the reference strain to de-
termine the 75 % eﬀective concentration (EC75). Following cell preparation, the library
is resuspended in 500 ţL staining buﬀer containing 100 nM either His/Avi tagged hu-
man HER2 (Acro Biosystems) conjugated to 50 nM streptavidin-AF647 (Invitrogen) or
tag-free human HER2 (Acro Biosystems) directly conjugated to AF647 via free amines.
Libraries are incubated with the probe overnight (16 h) with end-to-end rotation at
4◦C, centrifuged (4000 g, 5 min), and pellets are washed three times with PBS. Pellets
are then resuspended in 500 µL of staining buﬀer containing 26.5 nM anti-kappa light
chain:BV421 (BioLegend) and incubated for 2 hours with end-to-end rotation at 4◦C
prior to centrifugation (4000 g, 5 min), three washes with PBS and resuspension in 200
ţL of PBS for sorting.
Sorting
Libraries are sorted by one of two methods based on binding: the previously described
ACE Assay designed to give quantitative aﬃnity readouts [12, 64] or a binary version
of the ACE Assay. For either method, libraries are sorted on FACSymphony S6 (BD
Biosciences) instruments.
Immediately prior to sorting, 50 µL of stained sample is
transferred to a ﬂow tube containing 1 mL PBS + 3 µL propidium iodide. Aggregates,
debris, and impermeable cells are removed with singlets, size, and PI+ parent gating,
respectively. Cells are then gated to include only those with kappa light chain expression
(BV421). For the quantitative ACE Assay, collection gates are drawn to sample across
the log range of binding signal. The far right gate is set to collect the brightest 0.1 %
of the library and the far left gate is set to collect at the low end of the positive binding
signal based on stained control strains. Four additional gates of the same width are then
distributed in between, with each set to be approximately half the gMFI of the gate to
the right. For the binary version of the ACE Assay, a total of three collection gates are
set to sample at the high end of the binding range (top 0.1-2.5%, depending on overall
library positivity), the remaining positive binding signal events, and a negative gate

containing the events with no binding signal. Libraries are sorted simultaneously on up
to four instruments with photomultipliers adjusted to normalize ﬂuorescence intensity,
and the collected events are processed independently as technical replicates.
Next-generation Sequencing
Sorted Material Sample Preparation
Sample preparation for sequencing follows the same protocol for both the previously
described ACE Assay and the binary version of the ACE Assay. Cell material from
sorted gates is collected in a diluted PBS mixture (VWR), in 1.5 mL tubes (Eppendorf).
A sample of the unsorted library material is also processed for QC and ACE Assay metric
calculations. Post-sort samples are centrifuged (3,800 g) and tube volume is normalized
to 20 µl. Amplicons encompassing the HCDR3 or VH region are generated by PCR. The
reaction used 10 nM primer concentration, Q5 2x master mix (New England Biolabs)
and 20 µl of sorted cell material input suspended in diluted PBS (VWR). Reactions
are initially denatured at 98◦C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98◦C for 10 s; 59◦C
for 30 s; 72◦C for 15 s; with a ﬁnal extension of 72◦C for 2 min. After ampliﬁcation,
samples are cleaned enzymatically using ExoSAP-IT (Applied Biosystems). Resulting
DNA samples are quantiﬁed by Qubit ﬂuorometer (Invitrogen), prepped for sequencing
with the ThruPLEX DNA-Seq Kit (Takara Bio), normalized and pooled. Pool size is
veriﬁed via Tapestation 1000 HS and is sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 1000 P2
(2x150 nt or 2x300nt) with 20 % PhiX.
ACE Assay Analysis
In order to produce quantitative binding scores from reads, the following processing and
quality control steps are performed:
1. Paired-end reads are merged using FLASH2 [86] with the maximum allowed over-
lap set according to the amplicon size and sequencing reads length (150 bases for
all the libraries described in this manuscript).
2. Primers are removed from both ends of the merged read using the cutadapt tool
[87], and reads are discarded where primers are not detected.
3. Reads are aggregated across all FACS sorting gates and then discarded if (1) the
mean base quality is below 20, or (2) a sequence (in DNA space) is seen in fewer
than 10 reads across all gates.
4. FastQC [88] and MultiQC [89] are used to generate sequencing quality control
metrics.
5. For each gate, the prevalence of each sequence (read count relative to the total
number of reads from all sequences in that gate) is normalized to 1 million counts.
6. The binding score (ACE Assay score) is assigned to each unique DNA sequence
by taking a weighted average of the normalized counts across the sorting gates.
For all experiments, weights are assigned linearly using an integer scale: the gate
capturing the lowest ﬂuorescence signal is assigned a weight of 1, the next lowest
gate is assigned a weight of 2, etc.
7. Any detected sequence which is not present in the originally designed and synthe-
sized library is dropped.

8. ACE Assay scores are averaged across independent FACS sorts, dropping se-
quences for which the standard deviation of replicate measurements is greater than
1.25. An amino acid variant is retained only if we collected at least three indepen-
dent QC-passing observations between synonymous DNA variants and replicate
FACS sorts.
Binary ACE Assay Analysis
Enrichment scores are calculated for individual variants screened by a binary version of
the ACE Assay using the following procedure:
1. Paired-end reads are merged using Fastp [90] with quality ﬁltering and base cor-
rection in merged regions enabled.
2. Primers are removed from both ends of the merged read using the cutadapt tool
[87], and reads are discarded where primers are not detected.
3. Unique sequences are tallied to provide raw counts of each variant observed in
each sample. Sequences that did not match a designed sequence in the library are
discarded.
4. For each sample, proportional abundances are calculated for each variant. Enrich-
ment scores are calculated by dividing the proportional abundance of each variant
in a gate by its proportional abundance in the unsorted library sample.
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
Sample Preparation
Post induction samples are transferred to 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One), pelleted and
lysed in 50 µL lysis buﬀer (1X BugBuster protein extraction reagent containing 0.01 KU
Benzonase Nuclease and 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail). Plates are incubated for 15-
20 min at 30◦C then centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. After lysis, samples are
adjusted with 200 µL SPR running buﬀer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA,
0.01 % w/v Tween-20, 0.5 mg/mL BSA) to a ﬁnal volume of 260 µL and ﬁltered into
96-well plates. Lysed samples are then transferred from 96-well plates to 384-well plates
for high-throughput SPR using a Hamilton STAR automated liquid handler. Colonies
are prepared in two sets of independent replicates prior to lysis and each replicate is
measured in two separate experimental runs. In some instances, single replicates are
used, as indicated.
SPR
High-throughput SPR experiments are conducted on a microﬂuidic Carterra LSA SPR
instrument using SPR running buﬀer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA,
0.01 % w/v Tween-20, 0.5 mg/mL BSA) and SPR wash buﬀer (10 mM HEPES, 150
mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.01 % w/v Tween-20). Carterra LSA SAD200M chips are
pre-functionalized with 20 µg/mL biotinylated antibody capture reagent for 600 s prior
to conducting experiments. Lysed samples in 384-well blocks are immobilized onto chip
surfaces for 600 s followed by a 60 s washout step for baseline stabilization. Antigen
binding is conducted using the non-regeneration kinetics method with a 300 s associ-
ation phase followed by a 900 s dissociation phase. For analyte injections, six leading
blanks are introduced to create a consistent baseline prior to monitoring antigen bind-
ing kinetics. After the leading blanks, ﬁve concentrations of HER2 extracellular domain

antigen (ACRO Biosystems, prepared in three-fold serial dilution from a starting con-
centration of 500 nM), are injected into the instrument and the time series response was
recorded. In most experiments, measurements on individual DNA variants are repeated
four times. Typically each experiment run consists of two complete measurement cycles
(ligand immobilization, leading blank injections, analyte injections, chip regeneration)
which provide two duplicate measurement attempts per clone per run. In most exper-
iments, technical replicates measured in separate runs further double the number of
measurement attempts per clone to four.
Low Diversity Library Sequencing
To identify the DNA sequence of individual antibody variants evaluated by SPR, dupli-
cate plates are provided for sequencing. A portion of the pelleted material is transferred
into 96 well PCR (Thermo-Fisher) plate via pinner (Fisher Scientiﬁc) which contains
reagents for performing an initial phase PCR of a two-phase PCR for addition of Illu-
mina adapters and sequencing. Reaction volumes used are 12.5 µl. During the initial
PCR phase, partial Illumina adapters are added to the amplicon via 4 PCR cycles. The
second phase PCR adds the remaining portion of the Illumina sequencing adapter and
the Illumina i5 and i7 sample indices. The initial PCR reaction uses 0.45 µM UMI
primer concentration, 6.25 µl Q5 2x master mix (New England Biolabs) and PCR grade
H2O. Reactions are initially denatured at 98◦C for 3 min, followed by 4 cycles of 98◦C
for 10 s; 59◦C for 30 s; 72◦C for 30 s; with a ﬁnal extension of 72◦C for 2 min. Follow-
ing the initial PCR, 0.5 µM of the secondary sample index primers are added to each
reaction tube. Reactions are then denatured at 98◦C for 3 min, followed by 29 cycles
of 98◦C for 10 s; 62◦C for 30 s; 72◦C for 15 s; with a ﬁnal extension of 72◦C for 2 min.
Reactions are then pooled into a 1.5 mL tube (Eppendorf). Pooled samples are size
selected with a 1x AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) bead procedure. Resulting DNA
samples are quantiﬁed by Qubit ﬂuorometer. Pool size is veriﬁed via Tapestation 1000
HS and is sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq Micro (2x150 nt) for HCDR3 libraries or
an Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (2x300 nt) for HCDR1-HCDR3 libraries with 20 %
PhiX.
After sequencing, amplicon reads are merged using Fastp [90], trimmed by cu-
tadapt [87] and each unique sequence enumerated. Next, custom R scripts are applied
to calculate sequence frequency ratios between the most abundant and second-most
abundant sequence in each sample.
Levenshtein distance is also calculated between
the two sequences. These values are used for downstream ﬁltering to ensure a clonal
population is measured by SPR. The most abundant sequence within each sample is
compared to the designed sequences and discarded if it does not match any expected
sequence. Dominant sequences are then combined with their companion Carterra SPR
measurements.
Antibody Databases
The Observed Antibody Space (OAS) [11] was retrieved on February 1st, 2022. The
Structural Antibody Database (SAbDab) [22] was retrieved on August 29th, 2022. The
Coronavirus Antibody Database (CoV-AbDab) [80] was retrieved on December 21st,
2022.
To compute edit distance (number of mutations) between antibody sequences we use
the Levenshtein distance, denoted lev. The “Minimum HCDR3 edit distance to OAS”
is computed by taking the minimum edit distance between an HCDR3 of interest and
all HCDR3s in OAS:
min
y∈OAS lev(xHCDR3, yHCDR3).

This value is computed analogously for HCDR1 and HCDR2 as well as for other
databases such as SABdAB, CoV-AbDab, or our training data. The “Minimum HCDR123
edit distance to OAS” is computed by taking the minimum edit distance between the
tuple of HCDRs (HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3) belonging to an antibody of interest and
all such tuples in OAS (computed analogously for other databases):
min
y∈OAS (lev(xHCDR1, yHCDR1) + lev(xHCDR2, yHCDR2) + lev(xHCDR3, yHCDR3)) .
To compute the OAS HCDR3 length distribution (Table S4) we iterate through all
heavy chain sequences in OAS, consider the HCDR3 length, and maintain a tally of
HCDR3 lengths. We then restrict to HCDR3 sequences with lengths between 9 and 17
and normalize to get the length distribution. For the OAS-J HCDR3 length distribution
we do an analogous process but iterate only through heavy chain sequences in OAS that
have trastuzumab’s J-gene. For the SAbDab HCDR3 length distribution we take all
unique HCDR3s in SAbDab with lengths between 9 and 17 and compute the frequencies
at each length.
In Silico Structural Modeling
Three-dimensional models of selected de novo HCDR3 binders are created in PyMOL
[91] and the Crystallographic Object-Oriented Toolkit (Coot) [92] using the coordinates
of the trastuzumab-HER2 complex (PDB:1N8Z). Rosetta’s FastRelax application [75]
is applied using ﬂexible backbone and side-chain degrees of freedom parameters. Prior
to the relax procedure, we ﬁrst idealize all candidate structures using Rosetta’s Idealize
protocol to avoid steric clashes and improper geometry. We relax using the maximum
number of rotamers by passing -EX1, -EX2, -EX3 and -EX4 ﬂags at initialization.
We also include ﬂags -packing:repack_only to disable design, -no_his_his_pairE, and
-multi_cool_annealer 10 to set the number of annealing iterations.
For ranking of
conformations in FastRelax, we use Rosetta’s REF2015 energy function. It is well known
that running relax on a structure will often move the backbone a few Angstroms3, so
we include an additional term containing harmonic distance constraints for all pairs of
Cβ atoms that are either not part of a CDR loop or not within distance 10 to any atom
in a CDR loop, based on the conformation of the initial structure. These constraints
are given weight 10−4. The protocol is run ten times for each target, and we select the
decoy with the lowest energy in the HCDR3 loop.
Multi-Step CDR Design
In an earlier version of this manuscript, we reported successful design of multiple CDRs
using a multi-step generative AI design method, which we validated by SPR (Materials
and Methods). We have deprecated this method internally in favor of our latest de
novo methods. We report multiple binding designs to HER2 identiﬁed in a library of
fewer than 500 multi-step designed multi-HCDR variants (Table S8). We ﬁnd that these
binders again are distinct from examples in the model’s training data and antibodies in
the SAbDab and OAS databases (Figure S13).

edit distance to OAS HCDR3s. Naturalness score tends to decrease as distance to OAS
increases, which is expected since the Naturalness model is trained on OAS sequences.
Note that at minimum HCDR3 distance 0 to OAS the Naturalness scores of the designed
binders are on average higher than trastuzumab’s (p < 2·10−4) and for designed binders
with minimum distance one or fewer HCDR3 mutations from OAS have higher average
Naturalness scores than the OAS baseline (p < 10−13). (D) Naturalness scores of zero-
shot-designed binders vs. minimum edit distance to OAS HCDR123s. Note the presence
of designs up to 5 HCDR123 mutations away from OAS with higher naturalness than
trastuzumab. At 4 or fewer HCDR123 mutations to OAS the Naturalness scores of the
designed binders are on average higher than the OAS basline (p < 10−14).

Alignment of de novo designed VEGF binder to the HCDR3 of

binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) [78]. The designed
binder has an aﬃnity of 48.2 nM to VEGF-A, as measured by SPR, compared to sub-
nanomolar binding of ranibizumab (0.37 nM). The designed HCDR3 is diverse and novel
as it is 13 mutations away from ranibizumab’s HCDR3 and at least 4 mutations away
from any HCDR3 in OAS.

Fig S13. Multi-step multi-CDR design sequence analysis. (A) Distribution of
minimum edit distance to HCDR3s in SAbDab for multi-step multi-HCDR AI-designed
binders to HER2 (minimum of 3, maximum of 6, median of 4, mean of 4.39 ± 0.71
SD). Of the ﬁve designs with distinct HCDR1s from trastuzumab, three are at least
one mutation away from SAbDab and two are contained in SAbDab. Similarly, of the
19 designs with distinct HCDR2s from trastuzumab, 15 are at least one mutation away
from SAbDab and four are contained in SAbDab. This is expected given the fact that
HCDR1 and HCDR2 display lower sequence diversity than HCDR3. (B) Distribution
of minimum edit distance to HCDR123s in SAbDab for multi-step multi-HCDR AI-
designed binders to HER2 (minimum of 4, maximum of 11, median of 8, mean of
7.43 ± 1.50 SD). Note the increase in mutations compared to HCDR3 edit distance
despite the proximity of the HCDR1 and HCDR2 designs to SAbDab. (C) Distribution
of minimum edit distance to HCDR3s in OAS for multi-step multi-HCDR AI-designed
binders to HER2 (minimum of 0, maximum of 2, median of 1, mean of 1.39 ± 0.64 SD).
All HCDR1 and HCDR2 designs are contained in OAS, which is again expected given
their lower diversity. (D) Distribution of minimum edit distance to HCDR123s in OAS
for multi-step multi-HCDR AI-designed binders to HER2 (minimum of 3, maximum of
7, median of 5, mean of 5.26 ± 1.07 SD). Note the increase in mutations compared to
HCDR3 edit distance despite the HCDR1 and HCDR2 designs presence in OAS.
